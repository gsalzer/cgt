Introduction\r\n\r\nThis text is a plain English translation of the smart contract's programming logic and represent its terms of use (terms). This plain English translation is a best effort only and while all reasonable precautions have been taken to ensure that the smart contract will behave in the exact way outlined in these terms, mistakes do happen (see The DAO) which may result in unexpected and unintended contract behaviour which may include the total loss of invested funds (Ether), other tokens sent to it as well as accessibility of the contract itself. Due to the nature of smart contracts, once it is deployed on the blockchain it becomes immutably imbedded in it which means that any bugs and/or exploits discovered after deployment are unfixable. Should the code behave differently than outlined in these terms, the code - by the very nature of smart contracts - takes precedent over the terms. By deploying, interacting or otherwise using the smart contract you acknowledge and accept all associated risks while at the same time waive all rights to hold the creator of the smart contract, the artists who deployed the smart contract, its current owner as well as any other parties responsible for potential damages suffered by or caused by you through your interaction with the smart contract to yourself or others. No backsies.\r\n\r\n2. Contract deployment\r\n\r\nThis smart contract enables its owner to issue limited edition pieces of art (pieces) that are cryptographically embedded in the Ethereum blockchain. Every piece can be owned, offered for sale, sold, bought, transferred and burned. The contract accepts bid from interested buyers and allows for the cancelation of bids as well as the cancelation of pieces offered for sale and filling of bids. In addition the owner of the contract as well as Ethart will earn a commission for every future sales of pieces irrespective of who owns, buys or sells them using the contract.\r\n\r\nThe contract creation costs approximately 1.7-1.8 Mgas - assuming a gas price of 20 Gwei, contract creation will cost ~0.03-0.034 ETH or about $12 (@$300/ETH) on the Ethereum main net. If contract creation is not urgent and Ethereum's pending transactions pool is not congested gas prices can be lowered to ~4 Gwei which would reduce the cost of deployment to ~$2-$3 per artwork.\r\n\r\nDuring creation the contract asks for the following parameters:\r\n\r\n\t- The SHA256 hash of your piece (the cryptographic link of your artwork to the Ethereum blockchain)\r\n\t- Edition size (the maximum number of pieces you plan to issue)\r\n\t- Title (the title or name of your artwork, if any)\r\n\t- The link to your file (if any)\r\n\t- Custom text\r\n\t- The owner's commission in basis points (i.e. 1/100th of a percent)\r\n\r\nSHA256 hash: A SHA256 hash is a fixed length cryptographic digest of a file. On Mac and Linux it can be calculated by opening a terminal window and typing \"openssl sha -sha256\" followed by a space and the filename (i.e. \"openssl sha -sha256 <FILENAME>\") one wants to calculate the hash for. An online tool that serves the same purpose can be found at http://hash.online-convert.com/sha256-generator. By the nature of the cryptographic math the resulting hash is a) a unique fingerprint of the input file which can be independently verified by whomever has access to the original file, b) different for (almost) every file as long as at least one bit is different and c) almost impossible to reverse, meaning you can calculate a SHA256 hash from a file very easily but you can not generate the file from the SHA256 hash. Embedding the SHA256 hash in the contract at it's deployment therefore proofs that the limited edition pieces controlled by the smart contract's logic are linked to a particular file: the artwork.\r\n\r\nEdition size: The edition size is currently limited to a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 1,000 pieces.\r\n\r\nTitle: the title is stored as a public string in the contract\r\n\r\nFile link: So people can independently verify that a particular file is associated with a particular instance of a smart contract you can here specify the publicly accessible link to the file. Note that providing a link is not mandatory and some artists may decide to only provide the SHA256 hash and reveal the actual file associated with it at a later point in time or never.\r\n\r\nCustom text: This field can be whatever you want it to be. One use case could be a set of custom attributes for limited edition collectible playing cards. In this case you would format your game card attributes in a standard manner for later use e.g. Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom as \"12,8,6,9,3\" which a later application can then read and interpreted according to your game's rules.\r\n\r\nOwner's commission: the account that deploys the smart contract can set a commission for future sales that will be paid out to the current owner of smart contract. The commission is specified in basis points where 1 basis point equals 0.01%. The commission must be greater than 0 and lower than 9750. If the owner wants to receive 5% for all future sales for example the commission will have to be set as 500.\r\n\r\nAt deployment the owner of the smart contract will be set as the account that deployed it. Please make sure to carefully note down your account details including your address, private key, password, JSON file etc and keep it safe and secret. Remember: whoever has access to this information has access to the contract and all the funds and rights associated with it. If you loose this information it is almost certainly lost forever and your funds and artwork with it. Make at least one backup and keep it in a safe location. After contract deployment it is important for you to carefully note down the contract creation transaction receipt number, contract address and ABI for later reference. You and others will require this information to interact with the contract once it is live.\r\n\r\nThe contract acts as it's own decentralised exchange with an on chain order book of the lowest ask and highest bid for a piece and allows for trustless trade of the pieces of art via the Ethereum blockchain.\r\n\r\n3. Providing a proof\r\n\r\nAfter deployment and before the first pieces can be bought or sold the owner has to provide a proof. This proof demonstrates that the artwork was in fact deployed by the artist. The proof can be in the form of a link to a blog post, a tweet or press release providing at the very least the artwork's contract address or contract creation transaction number.\r\n\r\n4. Ethart commission\r\n\r\nThe fee for letting you deploy your artworks will be 2.5% of the edition size as well as 2.5% of future revenues. So you basically pay in art. After you have provided the proof, the contract issues 2.5% of the edition size to Ethart automatically as following:\r\n\r\n- 1 piece for every 40 pieces increase in edition size\r\n- a (remainder / 40) chance of an additional piece\r\n\r\nExample: Say you create a 100 piece limited edition artwork. The contract will then issue at least 2 pieces to Ethart. In addition there will be a 20 in 40 chance (i.e. 50%) that one additional piece will be issued to Ethart. In other words, if you create a limited edition of 1 piece there is a chance of 2.5% that after you provide the proof this one piece will be transferred to Ethart. To avoid disappointment we therefore recommend a minimum edition size of 2 - then you are guaranteed to keep at least one piece with an additional 5% chance of loosing the other. The way the math works out Ethart will on average retain 2.5% of all pieces.\r\n\r\nThe pieces transferred to Ethart can not be sold or transferred by Ethart for a minimum of one year (31,556,926 seconds) giving you plenty of time to monopolise the market.\r\n\r\n5. Changing the owner\r\n\r\nThe current owner can transfer ownership of the contract to another account.\r\n\r\n6. Transferring pieces\r\n\r\nYour artworks is in fact an ERC20 token (https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard) and supports all ERC20 features. Pieces can be transferred to other addresses (as long as they are not being offered for sale) by their respective owners. Make sure that pieces are only being transferred to accounts that have access to their private keys. Pieces send to exchanges or other accounts that do not have access to their private keys will be lost - most likely forever.\r\n\r\n7. Offering a piece for sale\r\n\r\nThe owner of a piece can offer it for sale. The price for which it is offered (the ask) has to be lower than the current lowest ask. Once a piece is offered for sale by its owner for a lower price than the currently lowest ask it will become the lowest ask and replace the previous lowest ask. The sale price has to be specified in wei (1000000000000000000 wei = 1 ETH). Offering a piece for sale at an ask that is lower or equal to the highest bid will result in an instant sale for the highest bid.\r\n\r\n8. Canceling a sale\r\n\r\nThe owner of a piece offered for sale can cancel the sale 24 hours after having offered the piece for sale. The 24 hour limited is intended to prevent owners to offer a piece at an artificially low price, displacing the currently lowest ask and then immediately canceling the sale.\r\n\r\n10. Buying a piece\r\n\r\nAs long as a piece is being offered for sale, anyone can buy it as long as the buyer sends at least the current lowest ask price with the buy order. Any buy orders that do not send at least the current lowest ask price will be rejects. All the funds send with a buy order will be paid out to the seller of the piece, the contract owner as well as Ethart respectively and in proportion to the commission rules outlined above. There will be no refunds for funds sent in excess of the lowest ask price. Once a piece has been sold the lowest ask will be reset and the next piece offered for sale will become the lowest ask if any. Patrons that buy pieces via the artwork\u2019s smart contract will be issued 2.5 Patron tokens for every Ether spend in the transaction.\r\n\r\n11. Placing a bid\r\n\r\nBuyers can place bids in wei (1000000000000000000 wei = 1 ETH). Bids have to be higher than the currently highest bid. Placing a bid that is higher than the current lowest ask price will result in the bidder instantly buying the piece offered by the lowest ask seller for the bid amount.\r\n\r\n12. Cancelling a bid\r\n\r\nBids can be canceled by the buyer 24 hours after they have been placed. The 24 hour limited is intended to prevent buyers from placing an artificially high bid, displacing the currently highest bid and then immediately canceling the bid.\r\n\r\n13. Filling a bid\r\n\r\nBids can be filled by anyone who owns a piece. The contract owner has a 24 hour exclusive first right of refusal to fill a bid.\r\n\r\n14. Burning a piece\r\n\r\nThe owner of a piece can burn it, removing it permanently from the pool of available pieces and thereby reducing the edition size. Artists may choose to do so to increase the value of the remaining pieces or for any other reason.\r\n\r\n\t(c) Stefan Pernar 2017 - all rights reserved\r\n\t(c) ERC20 functions BokkyPooBah 2017.
