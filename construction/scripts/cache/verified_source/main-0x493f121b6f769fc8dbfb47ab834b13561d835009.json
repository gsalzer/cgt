I'm fairly\r\n * confident it operates as described, but you may want to assure yourself of\r\n * its correctness - or wait for others to do so for you - before you trust your\r\n * ether to it. No guarantees, express or implied, are provided - use at your\r\n * own risk.\r\n * \r\n * @dev Ether vault contract. Stores ether with a 'time lock' on withdrawals,\r\n *      giving a user the chance to reclaim funds if an account is compromised.\r\n *      A recovery address has the ability to immediately destroy the wallet and\r\n *      send its funds to a new contract (such as a new vault, if the wallet)\r\n *      associated with this one is compromised or lost). A cold wallet or\r\n *      secure brain wallet should typically be used for this purpose.\r\n * \r\n * Setup:\r\n *   To set up a vault, first create a cold wallet or secure brain wallet to use\r\n *   as a recovery key, and get its address. Then, deploy this vault contract\r\n *   with the address of the recovery key, and a time delay (in seconds) to\r\n *   impose on withdrawals.\r\n * \r\n * Deposits:\r\n *   Simply deposit funds into this contract by sending them to them. This\r\n *   contract only uses the minimum gas stipend, so it's safe to use with\r\n *   sites that \"don't support smart contracts\".\r\n * \r\n * Withdrawals:\r\n *   Call unvault() with the amount you wish to withdraw (in wei - one ether is\r\n *   1e18 wei). After the time delay you specified when you created the wallet,\r\n *   you can call withdraw() to receive the funds.\r\n * \r\n * Vacations:\r\n *   If you anticipate not having access to the recovery key for some period,\r\n *   you can call `lock()` with a period (in seconds) that the funds should be\r\n *   unavailable for; this will prohibit any withdrawals completing during that\r\n *   period. If a withdrawal is outstanding, it will be postponed until the\r\n *   end of this period, too.\r\n * \r\n * Recovery:\r\n *   If your hotwallet is every compromised, or you detect an unauthorized\r\n *   `Unvault()` event, use your recovery key to call the `recover()` function\r\n *   with the address you want funds sent to. The funds will be immediately\r\n *   sent to this address (with no delay) and the contract will self destruct.\r\n * \r\n *   For safety, you may wish to prepare a new vault (with a new recovery key)\r\n *   and send your funds directly to that.\r\n */\r\ncontract Vault {\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Owner of the vault.\r\n     */\r\n    address public owner;\r\n    \r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Recovery address for this vault.\r\n     */\r\n    address public recovery;\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Minimum interval between making an unvault call and allowing a\r\n     *      withdrawal.\r\n     */\r\n    uint public withdrawDelay;\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Earliest time at which a withdrawal can be made.\r\n     *      Valid iff withdrawAmount > 0.\r\n     */\r\n    uint public withdrawTime;\r\n    \r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Amount requested to be withdrawn.\r\n     */\r\n    uint public withdrawAmount;\r\n\r\n    \r\n    modifier only_owner() {\r\n        if(msg.sender != owner) throw;\r\n        _;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    modifier only_recovery() {\r\n        if(msg.sender != recovery) throw;\r\n        _;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Withdrawal request made\r\n     */\r\n    event Unvault(uint amount, uint when);\r\n    \r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Recovery key used to send all funds to `address`.\r\n     */\r\n    event Recover(address target, uint value);\r\n    \r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Funds deposited.\r\n     */\r\n    event Deposit(address from, uint value);\r\n    \r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Funds withdrawn.\r\n     */\r\n    event Withdraw(address to, uint value);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Constructor.\r\n     * @param _recovery The address of the recovery account.\r\n     * @param _withdrawDelay The time (in seconds) between an unvault request\r\n     *        and the earliest time a withdrawal can be made.\r\n     */\r\n    function Vault(address _recovery, uint _withdrawDelay) {\r\n        owner = msg.sender;\r\n        recovery = _recovery;\r\n        withdrawDelay = _withdrawDelay;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function max(uint a, uint b) internal returns (uint) {\r\n        if(a > b)\r\n            return a;\r\n        return b;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Request withdrawal of funds from the vault.
