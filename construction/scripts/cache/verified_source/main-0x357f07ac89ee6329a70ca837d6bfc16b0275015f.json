Ethereum is a trademark owned by the Ethereum Foundation. A total of five percent (5%) of the Ethereum Sweepstake sale will be donated to the Ethereum Foundation for the continued support and development of the Ethereum Blockchain.\r\n// 7.\tThe Ethereum Sweepstake was invented by Hladun Rostyslav a citizen of the Ukraine, residing in the city of Lviv.  The Ethereum Sweepstake will pay the inventor and or to his nominee a total of five percent (5%) of the remaining Ethers.\r\n// 8.\tThe Ethereum Sweepstake and its SWEEP token are a smart contract which is transacted on the Ethereum Blockchain and as such are subject to Private International Law.  The  jurisdiction of the transaction(s) including the promotions sent to and or received by the users, the purchases of SWEEP Tokens, drawing of the winners and the payment of the winnings are deemed to be in the jurisdiction of the country of Costa Rica and all users of the Ethereum Sweepstake agree to said legal jurisdiction regardless of conflicts of law including whether minimum contact can be established within another jurisdiction. \r\n// 9.\t\r\n// 10.\tUpon selling the last SWEEP coin, a random selection running on the blockchain will be activated and the winners of the Ethereum Sweepstake will automatically be transferred the number of Ethers for the respective prizes.  Winning Ethers will only be sent to personal wallet address used to enter the Ethereum Sweepstakes and purchase the SWEEP coins.\r\n// 11.\tEthereum sent from an exchange and or brokerage accounts will be void and will not receive any potential winnings. We will no be liable for any losses in entries or potential winnings as a result of Ethereum being transferred from a brokerage and or exchange wallet.\r\n// 12.\tTransactions to enter Ethereum Sweepstakes are managed and confirmed via the Ethereum blockchain. You understand that your Ethereum public address will be made publicly visible when you enter the Ethereum Sweepstake.\r\n// 13.\tIf you decide to enter the Ethereum Sweepstake, we have no ability to reverse the transactions.  We also have no ability to payout any potential winnings to wallet address other than the wallet used to enter the Ethereum sweepstake. We will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via our website, or independently using our Smart Contract.\r\n// 14.\tEthereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a \u201cGas Fee\u201d) for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Ethereum network. This means that, even if you elect to interact directly via the Ethereum network, you will still need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the Ethereum network.\r\n\r\n// Disclaimer of Warranties\r\n// YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE ETHEREUM SWEEPSTAKE  IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK, AND THAT THE ETHEREUM SWEEPSTAKE iS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

The Users bears the sole responsibility to determine if the Ethereum Sweepstake winnings shall be a taxable event for the User. The Users bear full responsibility for timely and correct calculation and payment of all taxes due in accordance with the legislation applicable to the Users. The Service is not a tax agent of the User, as well as it does not advise the User on the order of calculation and/or the payment of taxes.\r\n\r\n// Notification About Risks\r\n// 1.\tThe User understands and accepts the risks in connection with transferring ETHERS to the Ethereum Sweepstake and creating a SWEEP Token as exemplary set forth above and hereinafter. In particular, but not limited, the User understands the inherent risks listed hereinafter:\r\n// 2.\tRisk of software weaknesses: The User understands and accepts that the Ethereum Sweepstake concept, the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain) is still in an early development stage and unproven, why there is no warranty that the process for creating Tokens will be uninterrupted or error-free and why there is an inherent risk that the software could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of ETH and/or Tokens.\r\n// 3.\tRegulatory risk: The User understands and accepts that the blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction and that it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, blockchain technology based applications, which may be contrary to the current setup of the Ethereum Sweepstake and which may, inter alia, result in substantial modifications of the Ethereum Sweepstakes, including its termination and the loss of ETHERS/Tokens for the User.\r\n// 4.\tRisk of Loss of private key: Tokens can only be accessed with a wallet seed or combination of private key and password. The private key is encrypted with a password. The User understands and accepts that if his wallet file or password respectively his private key got lost or stolen, the obtained Tokens associated with the User's Wallet or password will be unrecoverable and will be permanently lost with the Risk of theft: The User understands and accepts that the Ethereum Sweepstake concept, the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain) may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals that that could result in theft or loss of Sweep Tokens or ETHERS, impacting the ability to complete the Ethereum Sweepstake.\r\n// 5.   Risk of Ethereum mining attacks: The User understands and accepts that, as with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the Ethereum Sweepstakes is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, \u201cselfish-mining\u201d attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Ethereum Sweepstake, expected proper execution and sequencing of ETH/Token transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations.\r\n\r\npragma solidity ^0.4.18;\r\n\r\n// <ORACLIZE_API>\r\n/*\r\nCopyright (c) 2015-2016 Oraclize SRL\r\nCopyright (c) 2016 Oraclize LTD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
