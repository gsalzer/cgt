This is possible since any transfer that increases\r\nthe average balance in one account will be reflected by an equivalent reduction\r\nin the voting weight in the other.\r\nAt present a user may cast a vote only for one motion at a time,\r\nbut may cancel their vote at any time except during the confirmation period,\r\nwhen the vote tallies must remain static until the matter has been settled.\r\n\r\nA motion to confiscate the balance of a given address composes\r\na state machine built of the following states:\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting:\r\n  - A user with standing brings a motion:\r\n    If the target address is not frozen;\r\n    initialise vote tallies to 0;\r\n    transition to the Voting state.\r\n\r\n  - An account cancels a previous residual vote:\r\n    remain in the Waiting state.\r\n\r\nVoting:\r\n  - The foundation vetoes the in-progress motion:\r\n    transition to the Waiting state.\r\n\r\n  - The voting period elapses:\r\n    transition to the Confirmation state.\r\n\r\n  - An account votes (for or against the motion):\r\n    its weight is added to the appropriate tally;\r\n    remain in the Voting state.\r\n\r\n  - An account cancels its previous vote:\r\n    its weight is deducted from the appropriate tally (if any);\r\n    remain in the Voting state.\r\n\r\nConfirmation:\r\n  - The foundation vetoes the completed motion:\r\n    transition to the Waiting state.\r\n\r\n  - The foundation approves confiscation of the target account:\r\n    freeze the target account, transfer its nomin balance to the fee pool;\r\n    transition to the Waiting state.\r\n\r\n  - The confirmation period elapses:\r\n    transition to the Waiting state.\r\n\r\n\r\nUser votes are not automatically cancelled upon the conclusion of a motion.\r\nTherefore, after a motion comes to a conclusion, if a user wishes to vote \r\nin another motion, they must manually cancel their vote in order to do so.\r\n\r\nThis procedure is designed to be relatively simple.\r\nThere are some things that can be added to enhance the functionality\r\nat the expense of simplicity and efficiency:\r\n  \r\n  - Democratic unfreezing of nomin accounts (induces multiple categories of vote)\r\n  - Configurable per-vote durations;\r\n  - Vote standing denominated in a fiat quantity rather than a quantity of havvens;\r\n  - Confiscate from multiple addresses in a single vote;\r\n\r\nWe might consider updating the contract with any of these features at a later date if necessary.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n*/\r\n\r\ncontract Court is Owned, SafeDecimalMath {\r\n\r\n    /* ========== STATE VARIABLES ========== */\r\n\r\n    // The addresses of the token contracts this confiscation court interacts with.\r\n    Havven public havven;\r\n    EtherNomin public nomin;\r\n\r\n    // The minimum havven balance required to be considered to have standing\r\n    // to begin confiscation proceedings.\r\n    uint public minStandingBalance = 100 * UNIT;\r\n\r\n    // The voting period lasts for this duration,\r\n    // and if set, must fall within the given bounds.\r\n    uint public votingPeriod = 1 weeks;\r\n    uint constant MIN_VOTING_PERIOD = 3 days;\r\n    uint constant MAX_VOTING_PERIOD = 4 weeks;\r\n\r\n    // Duration of the period during which the foundation may confirm\r\n    // or veto a motion that has concluded.\r\n    // If set, the confirmation duration must fall within the given bounds.\r\n    uint public confirmationPeriod = 1 weeks;\r\n    uint constant MIN_CONFIRMATION_PERIOD = 1 days;\r\n    uint constant MAX_CONFIRMATION_PERIOD = 2 weeks;\r\n\r\n    // No fewer than this fraction of havvens must participate in a motion\r\n    // in order for a quorum to be reached.\r\n    // The participation fraction required may be set no lower than 10%.\r\n    uint public requiredParticipation = 3 * UNIT / 10;\r\n    uint constant MIN_REQUIRED_PARTICIPATION = UNIT / 10;\r\n\r\n    // At least this fraction of participating votes must be in favour of\r\n    // confiscation for the motion to pass.\r\n    // The required majority may be no lower than 50%.\r\n    uint public requiredMajority = (2 * UNIT) / 3;\r\n    uint constant MIN_REQUIRED_MAJORITY = UNIT / 2;\r\n\r\n    // The next ID to use for opening a motion.\r\n    uint nextMotionID = 1;\r\n\r\n    // Mapping from motion IDs to target addresses.\r\n    mapping(uint => address) public motionTarget;\r\n\r\n    // The ID a motion on an address is currently operating at.\r\n    // Zero if no such motion is running.\r\n    mapping(address => uint) public targetMotionID;\r\n\r\n    // The timestamp at which a motion began.

The backing the owner provides at issuance must\r\nkeep each nomin at least twice overcollateralised.\r\nThe owner may also destroy nomins in the pool, which is potential avenue\r\nby which to maintain healthy collateralisation levels, as it reduces\r\nsupply without withdrawing ether collateral.\r\n\r\nA configurable fee is charged on nomin transfers and deposited\r\ninto a common pot, which havven holders may withdraw from once per\r\nfee period.\r\n\r\nEther price is continually updated by an external oracle, and the value\r\nof the backing is computed on this basis. To ensure the integrity of\r\nthis system, if the contract's price has not been updated recently enough,\r\nit will temporarily disable itself until it receives more price information.\r\n\r\nThe contract owner may at any time initiate contract liquidation.\r\nDuring the liquidation period, most contract functions will be deactivated.\r\nNo new nomins may be issued or bought, but users may sell nomins back\r\nto the system.\r\nIf the system's collateral falls below a specified level, then anyone\r\nmay initiate liquidation.\r\n\r\nAfter the liquidation period has elapsed, which is initially 90 days,\r\nthe owner may destroy the contract, transferring any remaining collateral\r\nto a nominated beneficiary address.\r\nThis liquidation period may be extended up to a maximum of 180 days.\r\nIf the contract is recollateralised, the owner may terminate liquidation.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n*/\r\n\r\ncontract EtherNomin is ExternStateProxyFeeToken {\r\n\r\n    /* ========== STATE VARIABLES ========== */\r\n\r\n    // The oracle provides price information to this contract.\r\n    // It may only call the updatePrice() function.\r\n    address public oracle;\r\n\r\n    // The address of the contract which manages confiscation votes.\r\n    Court public court;\r\n\r\n    // Foundation wallet for funds to go to post liquidation.\r\n    address public beneficiary;\r\n\r\n    // Nomins in the pool ready to be sold.\r\n    uint public nominPool;\r\n\r\n    // Impose a 50 basis-point fee for buying from and selling to the nomin pool.\r\n    uint public poolFeeRate = UNIT / 200;\r\n\r\n    // The minimum purchasable quantity of nomins is 1 cent.\r\n    uint constant MINIMUM_PURCHASE = UNIT / 100;\r\n\r\n    // When issuing, nomins must be overcollateralised by this ratio.\r\n    uint constant MINIMUM_ISSUANCE_RATIO =  2 * UNIT;\r\n\r\n    // If the collateralisation ratio of the contract falls below this level,\r\n    // immediately begin liquidation.\r\n    uint constant AUTO_LIQUIDATION_RATIO = UNIT;\r\n\r\n    // The liquidation period is the duration that must pass before the liquidation period is complete.\r\n    // It can be extended up to a given duration.\r\n    uint constant DEFAULT_LIQUIDATION_PERIOD = 90 days;\r\n    uint constant MAX_LIQUIDATION_PERIOD = 180 days;\r\n    uint public liquidationPeriod = DEFAULT_LIQUIDATION_PERIOD;\r\n\r\n    // The timestamp when liquidation was activated.

Havvens are transferable ERC20 tokens,\r\nand also give their holders the following privileges.\r\nAn owner of havvens is entitled to a share in the fees levied on\r\nnomin transactions, and additionally may participate in nomin\r\nconfiscation votes.\r\n\r\nAfter a fee period terminates, the duration and fees collected for that\r\nperiod are computed, and the next period begins.\r\nThus an account may only withdraw the fees owed to them for the previous\r\nperiod, and may only do so once per period.\r\nAny unclaimed fees roll over into the common pot for the next period.\r\n\r\nThe fee entitlement of a havven holder is proportional to their average\r\nhavven balance over the last fee period. This is computed by measuring the\r\narea under the graph of a user's balance over time, and then when fees are\r\ndistributed, dividing through by the duration of the fee period.\r\n\r\nWe need only update fee entitlement on transfer when the havven balances of the sender\r\nand recipient are modified. This is for efficiency, and adds an implicit friction to\r\ntrading in the havven market. A havven holder pays for his own recomputation whenever\r\nhe wants to change his position, which saves the foundation having to maintain a pot\r\ndedicated to resourcing this.\r\n\r\nA hypothetical user's balance history over one fee period, pictorially:\r\n\r\n      s ____\r\n       |    |\r\n       |    |___ p\r\n       |____|___|___ __ _  _\r\n       f    t   n\r\n\r\nHere, the balance was s between times f and t, at which time a transfer\r\noccurred, updating the balance to p, until n, when the present transfer occurs.\r\nWhen a new transfer occurs at time n, the balance being p,\r\nwe must:\r\n\r\n  - Add the area p * (n - t) to the total area recorded so far\r\n  - Update the last transfer time to p\r\n\r\nSo if this graph represents the entire current fee period,\r\nthe average havvens held so far is ((t-f)*s + (n-t)*p) / (n-f).\r\nThe complementary computations must be performed for both sender and\r\nrecipient.\r\n\r\nNote that a transfer keeps global supply of havvens invariant.\r\nThe sum of all balances is constant, and unmodified by any transfer.\r\nSo the sum of all balances multiplied by the duration of a fee period is also\r\nconstant, and this is equivalent to the sum of the area of every user's\r\ntime/balance graph. Dividing through by that duration yields back the total\r\nhavven supply. So, at the end of a fee period, we really do yield a user's\r\naverage share in the havven supply over that period.\r\n\r\nA slight wrinkle is introduced if we consider the time r when the fee period\r\nrolls over. Then the previous fee period k-1 is before r, and the current fee\r\nperiod k is afterwards. If the last transfer took place before r,\r\nbut the latest transfer occurred afterwards:\r\n\r\nk-1       |        k\r\n      s __|_\r\n       |  | |\r\n       |  | |____ p\r\n       |__|_|____|___ __ _  _\r\n          |\r\n       f  | t    n\r\n          r\r\n\r\nIn this situation the area (r-f)*s contributes to fee period k-1, while\r\nthe area (t-r)*s contributes to fee period k. We will implicitly consider a\r\nzero-value transfer to have occurred at time r. Their fee entitlement for the\r\nprevious period will be finalised at the time of their first transfer during the\r\ncurrent fee period, or when they query or withdraw their fee entitlement.\r\n\r\nIn the implementation, the duration of different fee periods may be slightly irregular,\r\nas the check that they have rolled over occurs only when state-changing havven\r\noperations are performed.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we keep track also of the penultimate and not just the last\r\naverage balance, in order to support the voting functionality detailed in Court.sol.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\ncontract Havven is ExternStateProxyToken, SelfDestructible {\r\n\r\n    /* ========== STATE VARIABLES ========== */\r\n\r\n    // Sums of balances*duration in the current fee period.\r\n    // range: decimals; units: havven-seconds\r\n    mapping(address => uint) public currentBalanceSum;\r\n\r\n    // Average account balances in the last completed fee period.
