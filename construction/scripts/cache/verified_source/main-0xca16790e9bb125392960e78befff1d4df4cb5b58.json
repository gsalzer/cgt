The contract is attackable in a number of ways:\r\n * - as soon as someone paid in Ether and starts the game, register with a\r\n *   large number of addresses to spam the player list and most likely win.\r\n * - blockhash as source of entropy is attackable by miners\r\n * - probably further exploits\r\n * This only serves as a minimalistic example of how to gamble on Ethereum\r\n * Author: S.C.
