   A note on change paths -\r\n    Change path is a data structure that's used when changing a token to another token in the bancor network\r\n    when the change cannot necessarily be done by single changer and might require multiple 'hops'.\r\n    The path defines which changers should be used and what kind of change should be done in each step.\r\n\r\n    The path format doesn't include complex structure and instead, it is represented by a single array\r\n    in which each 'hop' is represented by a 2-tuple - smart token & to token.\r\n    In addition, the first element is always the source token.\r\n    The smart token is only used as a pointer to a changer (since changer addresses are more likely to change).\r\n\r\n    Format:\r\n    [source token, smart token, to token, smart token, to token...]\r\n\r\n\r\n    WARNING: It is NOT RECOMMENDED to use the changer with Smart Tokens that have less than 8 decimal digits\r\n             or with very small numbers because of precision
